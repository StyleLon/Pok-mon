Introducing Serv-U
----------------------
Serv-U is a flexible FTP server (or Daemon) for Microsoft Windows.
As the industry's most popular FTP server, Serv-U has a rich history
as a stable, fast, and feature-rich FTP server that's a breeze to
administer.  Available in 5 different editions, we've created a
version of Serv-U that's been tailored to your business or home
file-sharing needs.

For more information on Serv-U, visit our web site at:
http://www.Serv-U.com/

License Terms
-------------
It is OK to download and evaluate the program for free,
but continued use of a non-Personal edition installation requires a
license.  Your registration and payment means we can continue
development and free distribution of the program.

Registration entitles you to e-mail support and
upgrades for one or two years.  Single user copies start at
$49.95.  Quantity discounts, Site and Enterprise
licenses are available.

See http://www.Serv-U.com/pricing.htm for quantity
pricing.

Commercial use of the program (use within a business)
absolutely requires registration.
